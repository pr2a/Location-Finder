# Location-Finder

This program contains a Table View in which the user is able to add any city and as many as they want. 

Once the Table View Cell with the city name is clicked on, they will be able to see the location of that city on the map and will be able to enter a common word related to buildings close by (for example: pizza to see all the close-by pizza places) pinned on the map as well. The user will be able to search for as many places as they would like in that city.
